The User acknowledges that he/she knows and understands all the risks and implications of using cryptographic tokens and open-source software developed using blockchain technology.

1. ABOUT VIRIE

1.1. VIRIE is a decentralized online service that operates on a peer-to-peer basis. There is, therefore, no potential for its administration and moderation by third parties; it is designed using blockchain technology so that Users may enter information into the VIRIE Blockchain using VIRIE Tokens. Users use VIRIE at their own discretion and liability.

1.2. VIRIE is a peer-to-peer network: VIRIE operates without an administrative center, and its work (including the processing of transactions) is supported by an unlimited number of Users (including the Developers) who are equal. The algorithm for reaching consensus between them is a composite constructed through the combination of the Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work principles, which makes access to any control over or moderation of VIRIE impossible.

1.3. Blockchain is a technology for distributed data storage.

1.4. The VIRIE Token is an internal unit of account in the work of the decentralized online VIRIE service, which is offered to Users to enter information into the VIRIE Blockchain.

1.5. The limitations of liability provided by these Rules apply in full to all persons involved in the development of VIRIE, including the company that has provided the VIRIE source code ( hereinafter referred to as "Developers").

2. RISKS OF VIRIE USE

2.1. The User understands and acknowledges the potential for the following risks when using VIRIE, and expressly agrees that he/she is solely liable for all possible repercussions that may occur:


2.1.1. RISK OF REGULATORY ACTION IN ONE OR MORE JURISDICTIONS
VIRIE may fall within the jurisdiction of one or more legislative regulatory acts that may prohibit or restrict the operation of decentralized technologies or may prohibit or restrict the User's ability to use and/or own Tokens.

2.1.2. RISK OF HARD FORKS, NETWORK DIVISIONS, OR APPEARANCE OF ALTERNATIVE, INFORMAL NETWORKS
Hacking attacks, source-code errors, or actions by the Developers may lead to creation of alternative blockchains using the source code and protocol on which VIRIE is based or to other protocol changes that directly or indirectly affect VIRIE operations.

2.1.3. RISK OF LACK OF INTEREST IN THE PLATFORM
VIRIE may not be supported by a large number of Users and/or may only attract limited interest. This lack of interest could affect the development of VIRIE and the potential use of Tokens. The platform Developers cannot predict and do not guarantee the success of their exertions in the elaboration and development of VIRIE.

2.1.4. RISK TO PROGRAM CODE SECURITY AND SAFE WORK OF THE PLATFORM VIRIE is based on open-source software, and there is a risk that Users or other persons not directly related to VIRIE, including hackers, may make changes to the source code and other changes to any aspect of the VIRIE infrastructure, which could result in the loss and/or restriction of access to the functional elements of VIRIE, loss and/or restriction of access to VIRIE, or loss of the private keys required for access to the functional elements of VIRIE and VIRIE Tokens.

2.1.5. RISK OF PROBLEMS ARISING FROM USE OF THE PLATFORM
VIRIE may suffer cyberattacks, activity bursts, or other operational or technical problems that may cause interruptions in the operation of VIRIE, including but not limited to transaction delays, transaction processing shut-downs, loss of User data, or loss of VIRIE tokens. You agree to take the risks arising from technical problems, including those caused by cyberattacks. You agree to hold the Developers harmless for any losses incurred.

2.1.6. RISK OF EMERGENCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
Advances in cryptography or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers and other achievements may pose risks to the work of VIRIE and may also lead to theft or loss of Tokens.

2.1.7. RISK OF LOW OR NO LIQUIDITY
There is no guarantee that a VIRIE Token will be available for exchanges of every type of valuable, nor are VIRIE Tokens provided with liquidity guarantees. The exchange of Tokens is not guaranteed on value-exchanging platforms.

2.1.8. RISK OF UNINSURED LOSSES
Direct and indirect losses that Users may incur in connection with the use of VIRIE are not insured and are not covered by third parties.


2.1.9. INTERNET TRAFFIC TRANSFER RISKS

You acknowledge that the Developers are not liable for any communication errors, malfunctions, distortions, or delays that may occur when using VIRIE, whatever their cause.

2.1.10. CONTINGENCY RISKS
Blockchains and Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in paragraphs 2.1-2.1.9, there are risks that the Developers cannot foresee because of the novelty and experimental nature of the technology. In the event of any other risks which have not been described in this document, these will be considered to be unforeseen, such that the Developers are in no way liable for them. Users independently assume full responsibility in the event that unforeseen potential risks become a reality.

3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

3.1. The Developers are not liable for any repercussions occurring as a result of using VIRIE . VIRIE is completely without controls and cannot be administered, and once the Developers have placed the VIRIE source code in the public domain and VIRIE becomes supported by a sufficient number of Users, the Developers possess equal opportunities for its use, apart from the responsibility for issuing email notifications to Users about VIRIE functionality updates and network monitoring capabilities.

3.2. The Developers, their affiliates, and their respective officers, employees or agents are not responsible to You or anyone else for any damages of any kind, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or other damages (including loss of profits, trading losses, or damages resulting from the use of or inability to use VIRIE), even if the Developers have been notified of the potential for such damages.

3.3. Under no circumstances shall the Developers, their affiliates and respective officers, employees or agents be liable to the User or to any third parties for any indirect, incidental, or unintended damages, including loss of profits, damage to honor, dignity, or business reputation, which may occur in connection with the use of VIRIE, the maintenance of the work of VIRIE, or related to access to User data by third parties (including hackers), changes made to these data, or their corruption and destruction.

3.4. The Developers do not guarantee that Users will be able to exchange Tokens for goods, services, or any other assets by using VIRIE.
